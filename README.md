# Verum
# THE PROBLEM:
The modern news environment is one defined by oversaturation, rife with misinformation and inherent bias, and driven by attention-grabbing clickbait content. While some platforms are striving to maintain journalistic integrity and excellence, the fact remains that there is simply too much information and coverage available for users to process. Local news outlets are also dying out at an alarming rate, meaning that coverage of the news that most closely affects people is becoming less comprehensive and less common. Currently, discussions about local politics and news are largely limited to incensed rhetoric on minimally-read, densely-populated  chat boards. Engagement feels futile, and a comment culture of malicious language and misinformation discourages participation.

# OUR SOLUTION:
The Verum is a community-directed, town-hall-style news and discussion platform for micro-communities. With localized, exclusive groups, members are offered access to forums and conversations within communities of fellow students, co-workers, local residents, and others with shared characteristics. The Verum promotes healthy, productive discourse about topics ranging from the broadest national issues to local legislation; it functions as a safe space for users to express their ideas and beliefs about issues most important to them and their individual communities without fear of being drowned out.

# THE RUNDOWN:
Optimized for discourse in microcommunities: The Verum's offers small microcommunities that allow for all members to be heard. With high impressions per post, members are encouraged to post, and to post higher quality content. 

Community-directed discussion: A machine-learning engine generates query results ranked by popularity and by the search history of the user within the site. It also integrates Microsoft Text Analytics Machine Learning API to sift out explicit language, hate speech, and malicious content.

Scalabe back-end construction: The Verum's back-end database connection is built on Microsoft Azure, allowing for easy scalability and supporting future microcommunity development and propagation.

The Verum also features a mobile Android application as well as seamless webview interface accessible on any mobile device type. With a versatile homepage layout, efficient posting functionality, and clean, contained menu sidebar, the Verum is just as easily usable on a mobile device as it is on a computer. 

# FUTURE WORK:
Content cleanup: We also hope to integrate Microsoft Text Analytics' Sentiment Analysis operations to improve the language processing engine accuracy and completely root out the potential presence of hate speech and malicious content on the Verum.

Algorithm refinement: We hope to refine our algorithm to rank posts based on the posting experience of individual users as well as on their inclusion of academic citations. This addition would give greater priority to posts that have in-text citations and references to other articles and posts, academic journals, and previous events. This would help promote a culture of educated and informed discourse, furthering the mission of the Verum.
